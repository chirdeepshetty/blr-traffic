Bangalore traffic management
===========

This is an application to experiment with the idea of crowd-sourced traffic management

The Bangalore traffic police is about 3200 strong and needs to manage close to 39,00,000 (39 Lacs) vehicles on the road. To add to their problems, most drivers do not follow traffic rules. Jumping signals, 3 people riding together on a 2 wheeler, helmetless travel etc are very common here. Most of the fines are levied by the traffic police physically standing and watching at junctions. 

This obviously doesn't scale. And, given the strength of the traffic police, not all junctions can be manned at all times. This provides the incentive for most drivers to take a chance and commit a traffic violation. 

This is a radical idea to change the status quo. The idea, essentially, is to make use of the growing population to manage the traffic. Each junction needs to have a high resolution camera, that looks at the traffic and the lights need to be interlaced with the video. This video can then be split into 15-20 min chunks and uploaded on to youtube (or any other video sharing platform). The citizens look at the video and report offenses as they see them. The cops then need to just check at what time the most violations were reported.
